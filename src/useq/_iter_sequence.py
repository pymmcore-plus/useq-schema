    !!! note
        This method will usually be used via [`useq.MDASequence.iter_events`][], or by
        simply iterating over the sequence.

    This does the job of iterating over all the frames in the MDA sequence,
    handling the logic of merging all z plans in channels and stage positions
    defined in the plans for each axis.

    The is the most "logic heavy" part of `useq-schema` (the rest of which is
    almost entirely declarative).  This iterator is useful for consuming `MDASequence`
    objects in a python runtime, but it isn't considered a "core" part of the schema.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : MDASequence
        The sequence to iterate over.

    Yields
    ------
    MDAEvent
        Each event in the MDA sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : MDASequence
        The sequence to iterate over.
    base_event_kwargs : MDAEventDict | None
        A dictionary of "global" kwargs to begin with when building the kwargs passed
        to each MDAEvent.  These will be overriden by event-specific kwargs (e.g. if
        the event specifies a channel, it will be used instead of the
        `base_event_kwargs`.)
    event_kwarg_overrides : MDAEventDict | None
        A dictionary of kwargs that will be applied to all events. Unlike
        `base_event_kwargs`, these kwargs take precedence over any event-specific
        kwargs.
    position_offsets : PositionDict | None
        A dictionary of offsets to apply to each position. This can be used to shift
        all positions in a sub-sequence.  Keys must be one of `x_pos`, `y_pos`, or
        `z_pos` and values should be floats.s
