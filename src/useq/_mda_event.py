    Usually, this object will be generator by iterating over a
    [`MDASequence`][useq.MDASequence] (see [`useq.MDASequence.iter_events`][]).

    Attributes
    ----------
    index : dict[str, int]
        Index of this event in the sequence. This is a mapping of axis name
        to index.  For example: `{'t': 4, 'c': 0, 'z': 5},`
    channel : Channel | None
        Channel to use for this event. If `None`, implies use current channel.
        By default, `None`.  `Channel` is a simple pydantic object with two attributes:
        `config` and `group`.  `config` is the name of the configuration to use for this
        channel, (e.g. `"488nm"`, `"DAPI"`, `"FITC"`).  `group` is the name of the group
        to which this channel belongs. By default, `"Channel"`.
    exposure : float | None
        Exposure time in milliseconds. If not provided, implies use current exposure
        time. By default, `None`.
    min_start_time : float | None
        Minimum start time of this event, in seconds.  If provided, the engine will
        pause until this time has elapsed before starting this event. Times are
        relative to the start of the sequence, or the last event with
        `reset_event_timer` set to `True`.
    pos_name : str | None
        The name assigned to the position. By default, `None`.
    x_pos : float | None
        X position in microns. If not provided, implies use current position. By
        default, `None`.
    y_pos : float | None
        Y position in microns. If not provided, implies use current position. By
        default, `None`.
    z_pos : float | None
        Z position in microns. If not provided, implies use current position. By
        default, `None`.
    slm_image : SLMImage | None
        Image data to display on an SLM device. `SLMImage` is a simple pydantic object
        with two attributes: `data` and `device`. `data` is the image data (anything
        that can be cast to a numpy array), `device` is the name of the SLM device to
        use. If not provided, the "default" SLM device should be used. By default,
        `None`.
    sequence : MDASequence | None
        A reference to the [`useq.MDASequence`][] this event belongs to. This is a
        read-only attribute. By default, `None`.
    properties : Sequence[PropertyTuple] | None
        List of [`useq.PropertyTuple`][] to set before starting this event. Where each
        item in the list is a 3-member named tuple of `(device_name, property_name,
        property_value)`.  This is inspired by micro-manager's Device Adapter API, but
        could be used to set arbitrary properties in any backend that supports the
        concept of devices that have properties with values. By default, `None`.
    metadata : dict
        Optional metadata to be associated with this event.
    action : Action
        The action to perform for this event.  By default, [`useq.AcquireImage`][].
        Example of another action is [`useq.HardwareAutofocus`][] which could be used
        to perform a hardware autofocus.
    keep_shutter_open : bool
        If `True`, the illumination shutter should be left open after the event has
        been executed, otherwise it should be closed. By default, `False`."
        This is useful when the sequence of events being executed use the same
        illumination scheme (such as a z-stack in a single channel), and closing and
        opening the shutter between events would be slow.
    reset_event_timer : bool
        If `True`, the engine should reset the event timer to the time of this event,
        and future `min_start_time` values will be relative to this event. By default,
        `False`.
