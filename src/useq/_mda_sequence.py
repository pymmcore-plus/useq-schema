    """A sequence of MDA (Multi-Dimensional Acquisition) events.

    This is the core object in the `useq` library, and is used define a sequence of
    events to be run on a microscope. It object may be constructed manually, or from
    file (e.g. json or yaml).

    The object itself acts as an iterator for [`useq.MDAEvent`][] objects:

    Attributes
    ----------
    metadata : dict
        A dictionary of user metadata to be stored with the sequence.
    axis_order : str
        The order of the axes in the sequence. Must be a permutation of `"tpgcz"`. The
        default is `"tpgcz"`.
    stage_positions : tuple[Position, ...]
        The stage positions to visit. (each with `x`, `y`, `z`, `name`, and `sequence`,
        all of which are optional).
    grid_plan : GridFromEdges | GridRelative | None
        The grid plan to follow. One of `GridFromEdges`, `GridRelative` or `None`.
    channels : tuple[Channel, ...]
        The channels to acquire. see `Channel`.
    time_plan : MultiPhaseTimePlan | TIntervalDuration | TIntervalLoops \
        | TDurationLoops | None
        The time plan to follow. One of `TIntervalDuration`, `TIntervalLoops`,
        `TDurationLoops`, `MultiPhaseTimePlan`, or `None`
    z_plan : ZTopBottom | ZRangeAround | ZAboveBelow | ZRelativePositions | \
        ZAbsolutePositions | None
        The z plan to follow. One of `ZTopBottom`, `ZRangeAround`, `ZAboveBelow`,
        `ZRelativePositions`, `ZAbsolutePositions`, or `None`.
    uid : UUID
        A read-only unique identifier (uuid version 4) for the sequence. This will be
        generated, do not set.
    autofocus_plan : AxesBasedAF | None
        The hardware autofocus plan to follow. One of `AxesBasedAF` or `None`.
    keep_shutter_open_across : tuple[str, ...]
        A tuple of axes `str` across which the illumination shutter should be kept open.
        Resulting events will have `keep_shutter_open` set to `True` if and only if
        ALL axes whose indices are changing are in this tuple. For example, if
        `keep_shutter_open_across=('z',)`, then the shutter would be kept open between
        events axes {'t': 0, 'z: 0} and {'t': 0, 'z': 1}, but not between
        {'t': 0, 'z': 0} and {'t': 1, 'z': 0}.
