    An `Action` specifies what task should be performed during a
    [`useq.MDAEvent`][]. An `Action` can be for example used to acquire an
    image ([`useq.AcquireImage`][]) or to perform a hardware autofocus
    ([`useq.HardwareAutofocus`][]).  An action of `None` implies `AcquireImage`.

    You may use `CustomAction` to indicate any custom action, with the `data` attribute
    containing any data required to perform the custom action.

    Attributes
    ----------
    type : str
        Type of the action that should be performed at the [`useq.MDAEvent`][].

    autofocus_device_name : str, optional
        The name of the autofocus offset motor device (if applicable).  If `None`,
        acquisition engines may attempt to set the offset however they see fit (such as
        using a current or default autofocus device.)
    autofocus_motor_offset: float, optional
        Before autofocus is performed, the autofocus motor should be moved to this
        offset, if applicable. (Not all autofocus devices have an offset motor.)
        If None, the autofocus motor should not be moved.
