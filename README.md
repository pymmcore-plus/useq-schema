*An open, implementation-agnostic schema for describing multi-dimensional
microscopy experiments.*

**Documentation: <https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/useq-schema/>**

## Rationale

The `useq-schema` library defines a structured schema to represent a sequence of
microscope acquisition events. By adopting this schema, various microscopy
software tools can facilitate interoperability, allowing end users to
potentially switch between different control backends with ease. The goal is to
encourage a shared standard, making it straightforward for developers to adopt
useq-schema and enhance compatibility across tools.

**We are particularly interested in feedback from developers of microscopy-control
software**.  If you are interested in supporting the useq-schema in your software,
please open an issue or pull request to discuss how we can make that easier for
you, or to request additional features that would be necessary for your use case.

## `useq.MDAEvent`

The primary "event" object is `useq.MDAEvent`.  This represents a single event
that a microscope should perform, including preparation of the hardware, and
execution of the event (such as an image acquisition).

```python
from useq import MDAEvent

event = MDAEvent(
    channel="DAPI",
    exposure=100,
    x_pos=100.0,
    y_pos=100.0,
    z_pos=30.0,
    min_start_time=10.0,
    ... # multiple other fields
)
```

Downstream libraries that aim to support useq-schema should support driving
hardware based on an `Iterable[MDAEvent]`. See [`useq.MDAEvent`
documentation](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/useq-schema/schema/event/) for
more details.

<summary>Similar objects in existing software packages</summary>

- For [micro-manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager), this
  object is most similar (though not *that* similar) to the events generated by
  [`generate-acq-sequence`](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/blob/2b0f51a2f916112d39c6135ad35a112065f8d58d/acqEngine/src/main/clj/org/micromanager/sequence_generator.clj#L410)
  in the clojure acquisition engine.
- For [pycro-manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/pycro-manager), this
  object is similar to an individual [acquisition event
  `dict`](https://pycro-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apis.html#acquisition-event-specification)
  generated by
  [`multi_d_acquisition_events`](https://github.com/micro-manager/pycro-manager/blob/63cf209a8907fd23932ee9f8016cb6a2b61b45aa/pycromanager/acquire.py#L605),
  (and, `useq` provides a `to_pycromanager()` method that converts an `MDAEvent` into a
  single pycro-manager event dict)
- *your object here?...*

## `useq.MDASequence`

`useq.MDASequence` is a declarative representation of an multi-dimensional
experiment.  It represents a sequence of events: as might be generated by the
multidimensional acquisition GUI in most microscope software.  It is composed of
["plans" for each axis in the
experiment](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/useq-schema/schema/axes/) (such as a
Time Plan, a Z Plan, a list of channels and positions, etc.).  A
`useq.MDASequence` object is itself iterable, and yields `MDAEvent` objects.

See [`useq.MDASequence` documentation](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/useq-schema/schema/sequence/)
for more details.

<summary>Similar objects in existing software packages</summary>

- For [micro-manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager), this
  object is most similar to
  [`org.micromanager.acquisition.SequenceSettings`](https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager/blob/2b0f51a2f916112d39c6135ad35a112065f8d58d/mmstudio/src/main/java/org/micromanager/acquisition/SequenceSettings.java#L39),
  (generated by clicking the "Acquire!" button in the Multi-D Acquisition GUI)
- For [pycro-manager](https://github.com/micro-manager/pycro-manager), this
  object is similar to the
  [`multi_d_acquisition_events`](https://github.com/micro-manager/pycro-manager/blob/63cf209a8907fd23932ee9f8016cb6a2b61b45aa/pycromanager/acquire.py#L605)
  convenience function, (and `useq` provides a `to_pycromanager()`method that
  converts an `MDASequence` to a list of pycro-manager events)

### Example usage

```python
from useq import MDASequence

mda_seq = MDASequence(
    stage_positions=[(100, 100, 30), (200, 150, 35)],
    channels=["DAPI", "FITC"],
    time_plan={'interval': 1, 'loops': 20},
    z_plan={"range": 4, "step": 0.5},
    axis_order='tpcz',
)
```

The `MDASequence` object is iterable, yielding `MDAEvent` objects in the order
specified by the `axis_order` attribute.

```python
>>> events = list(mda_seq)

>>> print(len(events))
720 

>>> print(events[:3])
[MDAEvent(
    channel=Channel(config='DAPI'),
    index=mappingproxy({'t': 0, 'p': 0, 'c': 0, 'z': 0}),
    min_start_time=0.0,
    x_pos=100.0,
    y_pos=100.0,
    z_pos=28.0,
 ),
 MDAEvent(
    channel=Channel(config='DAPI'),
    index=mappingproxy({'t': 0, 'p': 0, 'c': 0, 'z': 1}),
    min_start_time=0.0,
    x_pos=100.0,
    y_pos=100.0,
    z_pos=28.5,
 ),
 MDAEvent(
    channel=Channel(config='DAPI'),
    index=mappingproxy({'t': 0, 'p': 0, 'c': 0, 'z': 2}),
    min_start_time=0.0,
    x_pos=100.0,
    y_pos=100.0,
    z_pos=29.0,
 )]
 ```

Both `MDAEvent` and `MDASequence` objects are pydantic models, so they can be
easily serialized to and from json or yaml.

```py
print(mda_seq.yaml())
```

```yaml
axis_order: tpcz
channels:
- config: DAPI
- config: FITC
stage_positions:
- x: 100.0
  y: 100.0
  z: 30.0
- x: 200.0
  y: 150.0
  z: 35.0
time_plan:
  interval: 0:00:01
  loops: 20
z_plan:
  range: 4.0
  step: 0.5
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install useq-schema
```

or, with conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge useq-schema
```

## Executing useq-schema experiments with pymmcore-plus

[pymmcore-plus](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-plus) implements an
acquisition engine that can execute an iterable of `MDAEvents` using
micro-manager in a pure python environment (no Java required).

```python
from pymmcore_plus import CMMCorePlus

core = CMMCorePlus()
core.loadSystemConfiguration()  # loads demo by default

core.mda.run(mda_seq)  # run the experiment

# or, construct a sequence of MDAEvents anyway you like
events = [MDAEvent(...), MDAEvent(...), ...]
core.mda.run(events)
```

This can be considered a "reference implementation" of an engine that supports useq-schema. 

See [pymmcore-plus documentation](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/examples/mda/) for details.
